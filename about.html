            <h4>Where it All Began</h4>
            <p><span class="bold-span">I love design. That connection probably began when I was finally able to put together LEGO bricks as a kid and only grew as I covered the family living room in a tsunami of scrap paper and magic marker bins.</span> One of my favorite things to do as an eight-year old was build on my cardboard city for matchbox cars. I was literally content for hours with empty corrugated boxes, index cards, scotch tape, and my trusty old Washable Crayolas. Each summer it would seem to get bigger and better. I added new billboards, roads, and buildings based on places I visited and how I interpreted the world around me. My parents told me stories about how they had to check on me because they never heard a peep from my playroom all weekend. I loved every minute of that state of flow. So, you would think the next logical chapter of my story would be to take lots of art classes in high school and go on to earn my design chops in college because I was just following what I loved to do. Well, not exactly.</p>

            <h4>The First Lesson</h4>
            <p>Fast forward to college, I did try a few classes within the graphic design track at UW-Milwaukee, dipping my toes into the waters of Photoshop and art history. It was interesting and fun, but I still felt like something was missing. I wanted to help others, leave an impact, make a difference, pay it forward; even if it sounds cliched I knew myself and how important feeling that satisfaction in my career was going to be. At the time, I just didn’t see how much designers do impact people through their work and the relationships they foster to bring that work alive. Instead, I saw teaching as a career that could fulfill that desire.</p>
            <p>My first experience as the teacher in a real classroom was exciting. Important role models in my life said they thought I would make an excellent teacher. As I practiced, evaluations and field observations came back seeming to glow. I easily connected with kids. I saw students learning and growing just as I had imagined. I was becoming that role model I aspired to be. And then it happened; my first full-time position right out of graduation in a saturated competitive job market of high school social studies teachers. I thought this was it. I made it. Yet, I quickly discovered the shoe didn’t actually fit.</p>

          <h4>Lost and Found</h4>
          <p>In fact, the shoe ultimately became painful to wear some days. Why? Not because of the tremendous pressures teachers face as professionals today (though what teacher doesn’t find themselves under stress). <span class="bold-span">I left because I was no longer honoring my true self&hellip;the little spirit I left behind in the remnants of that cardboard city.</span> I could not find opportunities for that creative spark to flourish through my work. There was no experimentation within increasing standardization. I didn’t feel that satisfaction in what I poured my heart and soul into everyday. I mean, don’t we all want to feel that in what we do? So I found myself inching every year closer to a crossroads. <span class="bold-span">Do I keep going down this path or do I listen to my intuition</span> and find the answer to the question &#8220;what would I really love?&#8221;</p>
          <p>I love making and creating things. I love working with others and connecting with people. I love the challenge of having to keep learning and growing. I love technology and understanding how it can transform life and culture.</p>
          <p>Reflecting on that question, without prejudgement, without listening to the gremlins of self-doubt, without placing limitations based on circumstances helped me realize there was a part of me desperate to grow--a passion--I never truly tapped into. The ball was in my court.</p>

            <h4>Building <s>Blocks</s> Bloc</h4>
            <p>At first, I dribbled, learning to code HTML and CSS part-time through <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>. I took a few more steps with some great courses on lynda.com. I reached out to friends and family who were looking for help with flyers and business cards. Sure, I made some embarrassing airballs, but for the first time again I felt that state of flow every moment I was up late completing a code challenge or tearing my hair out trying to make some CSS positioning behavior work. I felt empowered to start moving towards a new career as I learned on my own. However, as a teacher, I understood the difference between teaching yourself and learning from experts and the growth that occurs when finding a mentor. If I wanted to be a professional designer, I needed professional training and guidance from a professional mentor. With a family to support and my wife and I expecting our first baby though, quitting my day job to study part time at a local college or dropping everything for a bootcamp wasn’t exactly an option. <span class="bold-span">Then came BLOC.</span></p>
            <p>Through <a href="https://www.bloc.io/ux-design-bootcamp" target="_blank">BLOCs UX Design Apprenticeship</a> program, I had the professional guidance and the immersiveness I needed to hone my skills to be taken seriously. I jumped into the deep end to start my journey. Between taking care of my responsibilities as a full-time teacher and spending time with my wife Leslie as we prepared to become new parents, I was brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, coding, collaborating with <a href="http://www.designhawg.com/" target="_blank">Chris Courtney</a> (my amazing and humble mentor) and breathing everything I could possibly consume about the UX design process.</p>

          <h4>Connecting the Dots</h4>
          <p>As I finished my apprenticeship and started to look backwards to write my story, I realized just how similar the qualities are between a great teacher and a great designer. They can both distill concepts into their simplest forms. They can each collaborate with many different stakeholders and empathize with their perspective. They effortlessly juggle multiple projects, tasks, and needs over the course of the day, the week, and the long-term. They regularly share ideas and defend them not just with beliefs but with concrete evidence. And, each professional solicits feedback and reflects on their process to keep improving their craft.</p>
          <p>Most importantly though, great teachers and great designers are completely invested in the problems they are trying to solve. In other words, <span class="bold-span">because of the intrinsic love for their work, they will ultimately be able to find the best solutions and impact the people and relationships that matter most</span> to the problem at hand.</p>
