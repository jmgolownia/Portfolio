        <p><span class="bold-span">Think back to three favorite memories from your school-days. Was one of them a special trip you took?</span> I’d bet if you really thought about it, at least one of them would be. Those experiences can be magical and powerful; maybe it opened your eyes to a new culture, expanded your world beyond home, or gave you an opportunity to act independently. Sure you probably had fun just being there with friends, but it had a lasting impact far beyond the day to day lessons your teacher directed.</p>
        <p>Imagine if you as a student could have traveled somewhere new every year beyond just the normal one-day field trips. How would that have changed you and other peers in your school community?</p>
        <p>So, how could we make that happen, or at the very least make it easier for teachers to organize these experiences?</p>

            <h4>The Budget Dilemma</h4>
            <p><span class="bold-span">TripSprout</span> was born out of my frustration as a teacher with finding the capital and resources for student travel. Even making short field-trips happen always felt like an uphill battle. With school district budgets continuing to shrink to the bare minimum, most teachers are left with fundraising options that produce small margins for large time investments.</p>
            <p>You could run a bake sale, but these represent a fraction of what you typically need. You can go soliciting donations from local businesses. Many teachers go this route. However, it’s another huge time requirement beyond already inflated professional responsibilities. There are plenty of food and novelty companies that love to get students to market their products. But lets be honest, when a kid asks if you’d like to buy a magazine subscription, or 10 rolls of wrapping paper, or a tub of cookie dough (that you’re probably never going to finish), most adults don’t really want the product or to pay the premium price. <span class="bold-span">Yet, we buy it anyway. Why? Because we want to help the student; we want them to have this invaluable experience and we believe our purchase will help them get there.</span></p>
            <p>Thinking about the power of social media and sites like <span class="italic-span">Kickstarter</span> or Indiegogo, I started to dig into the concept of a fundraising app purely focused on travel. Instead of relying on the “middlemen” profit-sharing programs, or the efforts of one teacher to solicit donations, why not create a platform that put the power of crowdfunding into the teachers (and students) hands?</p>  
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="build-it row">
        <div class="large-10 large-offset-1 columns">
          <h4>If You Build it, Will They Come?</h4>
          <p>After some initial brainstorming, I began with a competitive analysis of similar products aimed at funding teacher related goals. Among the most popular were donorschoose.org and Adopt-a-Classroom.</p>
          <img src="images/donorschoose.png">
          <p>Both of these sites had generated millions of dollars for teachers and multiplied the efforts of thousands of ordinary donors for some truly great projects. However, neither really had a niche that catered to big student travel experiences. Instead, donorschoose focused on the small school-day field trips and Adopt-a-Classroom was only geared toward general classroom and project supplies that teachers would normally have to buy on their own.</p>
          <p>Clearly, a market seemed to appear for a new tool like TripSprout. At this stage though, the concept needed further proofing from the real stakeholders.</p>
          <p>As a one-man UX team, I created a <a href="#">survey</a> to understand teacher attitudes and needs in a few key areas of the product.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Beliefs towards the merit of planning trips</li>
            <li>Perceptions about fundraising options</li>
            <li>Past actions regarding planning trips</li>
            <li>Future goals for planning trips (if there were no limitations)</li>
            <li>Attitudes towards using a fundraising app vs traditional methods</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="">
          <img src="">
          <p>If I had more time and resources for the user research portion of this phase,  I would have prefered to increase the sample size beyond 20 responses. However, after surveying colleagues at work, through Facebook and an online teacher forum, I thought the results were particularly revealing despite the small number of users.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>85% Would prefer to donate directly to a student rather than buy a product</li>
            <li>55% Would like to organize international travel if there were no funding limitations</li>
            <li>55% would organize 1-2 trips per year and 40% would organize 3-4 trips per year if securing funding was easier</li>
            <li>Future goals for planning trips (if there were no limitations)</li>
            <li>And if they could use an online tool to collect donations, over 80% responded as more likely to organize trips within a given year</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I was ecstatic knowing real users not only had a desire to use TripSprout, but that my design could solve a real problem and in turn make a lifelong impact on students.</p>

          <div class="large-10 large-offset-1 columns">
            <h4>Designed For A Teacher By A Teacher</h4>
            <p>As a soon-to-be former teacher, I was also a user of this product, but I needed to get out of my own head and into the mind of other users. Perspective taking is a skill I always worked on with my students, but even for someone with more life experience, it’s still not easy.</p>
            <img src="#">
            <p>These user personas are far from perfect. Nevertheless, they were a crucial exercise that helped me to see the goals, needs and motivations of the teachers I was ultimately designing TripSprout for.</p>
            <p>Mapping out the <a href="#">user flows</a> then allowed me to narrow the scope of the project and identify the features most important for initial deployment. While I knew the donors were the other half of the equation to the success of TripSprout, I also recognized that at that point I just didn’t have the time or user research to properly address the design of tasks related to the donor user flow.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="row">
        <div class="identity large-10 large-offset-1 columns">
          <h4>Mapping Out the Identity</h4>
          <p>By now I’ve given you the impression that TripSprout was part of the concept from the beginning. However, the name only came after rounds of sketching, reflection, and letting ideas “slow-boil” (as Von Glitschka describes in his logo design process). The first--now cringeworthy--name that deciminated from my frontal lobe was, as my mentor Chris hilariously pointed out, something that sounded like an orwellian government initiative. I was trying to convey the metaphor of the travel as a way to bridge the gap that sometimes exists between the classroom and the world outside too literally. It was a start though.</p>
          <img src="#">
          <p>Eventually, TripSprout came to fruition. I’ll admit, it was one of those midnight flashes of insight that I scribbled down on a notepad on my way to bed, but I think it resulted from following the process without forcing the execution.</p>
          <img src="#">
          <p>Trip makes it clear that the fundraising platform is only focused on travel. Sprout represents the concept of literally growing the idea (seed) that the teacher organizes for their students through donations. As in nature, there could be a downpour of rain where huge growth occurs in a single bound, or a few minutes of sunlight that moves the plant closer to blossoming. Thus, maybe a donor from halfway around the world contributes $1,000 to the goal, but that doesn’t diminish the collective domino effect of every student's family member contributing $5 to the campaign. Moreover, I think teachers want a travel experience to sprout bigger worldviews, expanded ways of thinking, and foster new understandings of people and places.</p>
          <img src="#">
          <p>I opted to pursue the Globe concept from the sketches in addition to the visual of growth as denoted by the plants. The exploration of the map icon developed through some excellent mentor-mentee collaborative discussion because of its ubiquitous nature in digital mapping and travel tools.</p>
          <img src="#">
          <p>In the end, I felt both logos successfully conveyed the meaning behind TripSprout. The second mark won out though. It was a stronger representation of the personal growth of students and the growth of the trip from possibility to reality with donations. </p>
          <img src="#">
          <p>I selected the typeface Lato for both logos (and the overall design) as it reminded me of the highly legible type that you see on wayfinding signs at airports and railway stations. Lato also has a lot of superb weights that can be used to create hierarchy and emphasis throughout the copy. However, I also wanted to give the design touches of individual personality to help users feel more connected to the product. The script typeface FF Market does this nicely with its unique curvature and without sacrificing legibility. It’s like you’re looking at the greetings printed on those postcards your friends used to send to you while they were off visiting some exotic destination.  Oh, and for the Typekit team, if I haven’t said it already, thank you for curating such beautiful type selections!</p>
          <img src="#">
          <p>Finally, I wanted the color palette to reflect the diversity of the places teachers wanted to take students to experience. Yes, we know the adage “less is more” is often is good rule of thumb in design. In this case, though, a splash of complementary colors was needed to send that message and to reinforce the feeling of excitement and energy.</p>
          <img src="#">

      <section class="row">
        <div class="design-direction large-10 large-offset-1 columns">
          <h4>Finessing the Design Direction</h4>
          <p>From the beginning, I knew the wireframes had to focus on two goals; telling the stories behind trips created through TripSprout and making it easy for teachers to manage the content and fundraising campaigns.</p>
          <img src="#">
          <p>To aid in storytelling, ample space was allocated to large hero images and quotes that would help users personally connect with the product. Their own inspiration and desire to go to these places and embody the message of the quote could potentially translate into action. As such, space for these beautiful and bold images were carried through the teacher dashboard as well as campaign pages donors would see.</p>
          <img src="">
          <p>You’ll notice in the wireframe iterations, the focus was reoriented towards helping the teacher tell the story. Fields for descriptive content (i.e. why does taking students on this trip matter) were emphasized while logistical information was pushed aside. This is where the user focus needed to be. Pictures of the destination and students draw the visitor in, but it's the content that will compel users to click and donate. Additionally, I decided to give teachers more control over the donation call to actions. Here, teachers could describe, and donors could then see, how each contribution would directly help a student. A donor can internalize the fact that their $20 could help a student see the White House and maybe meet the First Lady. It’s a less incentivizing to contribute when I don’t understand how my donation is being used, especially if I have no personal connection to this teacher or these kids whatsoever. </p>
          <img src="">
          <p>Analytic information, displayed in counter information and charts, gave teachers the ability to quickly monitor campaign progress without wasting time. This also made it clear to donors just how close or far away a campaign was to being funded successfully.</p>
          <p>One high-fidelity mockup of the homepage set the final calibration to the compass. The images, color and typography worked together. There was a rhythm, hierarchy and balance to the composition and it was enough of a base to operate from. Since most of the other page designs were borrowing styles from the homepage, it was easier to save time and move into the development phase rather than testing everything out inside of Sketch.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-10 large-offset-1 columns">
            <h4>Getting SASSy with Foundation</h4>
            <p>For the development phase of TripSprout, I utilized the power of Foundation (v5 to be exact). Previously, the only other framework I had build a project with was Skeleton. I liked the lightweight approach of Skeleton, but I wanted to learn one of the most popular frameworks in use (besides Bootstrap), and I needed more control over the responsive design of TripSprout.</p>
            <p>Foundation also integrated nicely with SASS. I had some exposure to SASS through Treehouse before and I remembered how much it amazingly simplified CSS coding, so I wanted to jump back into the saddle. Plus, writing all of the media queries that were coming down the pipeline was going to be much less painful. Work smarter, not harder.</p>
            <img src="#">
            <p>Adding a little Javascript was the final development hurdle to overcome. I haven’t had a lot of time to spend with Javascript (though it’s a goal to improve on it), so it was personally challenging to implement Chart.js to handle the small pie chart progress indicator. The final execution is better for it though and it was exciting to see an element of the design become alive and somewhat interactive rather than a static PNG.</p>

      <section class="lessons-learned row">
        <div class="large-10 large-offset-1 columns">
          <h4>Lessons Learned</h4>
          <p>TripSprout was a labor of love. The project helped me to stretch in ways I had never anticipated growing and I’m a better designer today because of the work I was challenged in BLOC to complete. Personally, it also marks the transition from my career as a classroom teacher, to that of a UX designer. I’m proud of the skills I developed and the tools I learned designing this fundraising app, but I’m also proud of the way I was able to honor my past experiences as a teacher with the goals I have in mind as a UX Designer in the future.</p>
          <p>Looking at the future evolution of the project, I would focus on the UX, UI and development of the donor user flow; specifically searching for projects and the shopping cart experience of donating (donorschoose.org has a fantastic UX flow there). I would also like to explore learning more Javascript to prototype what it would look like for teachers to share campaigns via social media and to thank and connect with donors who contributed to each trip.</p>
          <p>I believe TripSprout is actually a viable concept. It needs more user testing of course, but I’ve seen how travel experiences open doors for students. Talking with a set of parents at my last conferences, they commented to me how much their daughter loved going to the Model United Nations conference that I organized for students. They said she couldn’t stop talking about it at dinner. Hearing that made all of the hard work fundraising worth it. To give you perspective though, to bring 18 students to an overnight conference a little over an hour away from our town cost nearly $2,500. It was worth every penny, but most of that money had to come from parents. Well, what about all of those students who could have benefited, and their parents couldn’t afford to make a contribution? I wish I would have had a tool like this.</p>
          <p>Maybe it’s something I’ll partner with others and begin a startup someday. For now though, I’m content with the wealth of knowledge I walked away with as a UX designer.</p>
          <p>Thanks for taking a peek into my process,</p>
